          Prioritizing Flow & Functionality

        {/* Paragraph */}
        <p className="text-[#292a62] mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          A key principle in commercial kitchen design is **flow planning**. Dividing the space into clear zones‚Äîpreparation, cooking, and cleaning‚Äîhelps minimize movement, reduces cross-contamination, and increases speed. Smart layouts reduce staff collisions and improve communication.

        <p className="text-[#292a62] mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          For open or front-facing kitchens, **aesthetic considerations** are key. Custom display counters, clean lines, and warm finishes turn your kitchen into a branded experience. Sleek surfaces and hidden wiring ensure the kitchen looks as professional as it functions.
